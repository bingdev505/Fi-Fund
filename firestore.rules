/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring clear ownership.
 * - User profiles are stored directly under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Subcollections under `/users/{userId}` store related data like transactions, debts, bank accounts, and chat history.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent enumeration.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document data is enforced on create and update.
 * - All write operations require the user to be signed in.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The userId is denormalized into each subcollection document. This allows efficient
 *   security rules without additional `get()` calls to the `/users/{userId}` document.
