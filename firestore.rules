/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the personal finance application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control
 * over their own data, and no user can access another user's data. Data validation
 * is relaxed during this prototyping phase to allow for rapid iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database is structured with user-specific data nested under the `/users/{userId}`
 * path. This structure ensures that data is isolated and access can be controlled
 * on a per-user basis.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own data.
 * - Data validation is minimal, focusing on relational integrity (e.g., userId consistency) rather than complete schema enforcement.
 * - Listing user collections is allowed only to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To avoid costly `get()` calls, documents under `/users/{userId}` should include the `userId`
 * field within the document itself. This allows for efficient ownership checks without
 * additional reads.
