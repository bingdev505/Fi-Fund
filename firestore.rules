/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for transactions, debts, and bank accounts.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Data consistency is enforced between the path and the document's internal userId field.
 * - For all `update` and `delete` operations, existence of document must be verified before proceeding.
