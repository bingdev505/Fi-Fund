/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user has a dedicated data tree under `/users/{userId}`.
 * All data (incomes, expenses, creditors, and debtors) is nested under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/incomes/{incomeId}: Stores income entries for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense entries for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/creditors/{creditorId}: Stores creditor information for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/debtors/{debtorId}: Stores debtor information for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - List operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - No public data or shared access is allowed in this initial prototype.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` field is denormalized into each document within the income, expense, creditor, and debtor subcollections. This allows for simple and efficient authorization checks based on `request.auth.uid` without needing additional `get()` calls.
