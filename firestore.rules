/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user can only
 *              access their own data, and no global roles or shared access are implemented.
 * @dataStructure All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring clear ownership.
 * @keySecurityDecisions Listing of users is disallowed, and all data access is predicated on
 *                       the authenticated user's UID matching the userId path parameter. This
 *                       prevents unauthorized data access and protects user privacy.
 * @denormalization For authorization simplicity, each document includes a userId field that must
 *                  match the userId in the path. This avoids costly `get()` operations in the
 *                  rules.
