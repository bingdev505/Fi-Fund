/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only
 * create, read, update, and delete data associated with their own user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that all collections are
 *scoped to individual users. This structure simplifies security rules and
 * prevents unauthorized data access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied.
 * - All data validation is skipped in this prototyping phase, except
 *   for ownership checks on the 'id' field.
 * - Read operations are generally restricted to the owner, though `get` requests
 *   to non-existent documents will still reach the backend to return a 404.
 * - All write operations require a verified, signed-in user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'userId' field is present on all documents to simplify ownership checks.
 * This avoids costly `get()` operations to parent documents.
