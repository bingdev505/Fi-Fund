/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/incomes/{incomeId}: Stores income entries for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense entries for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/creditors/{creditorId}: Stores creditor information for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/debtors/{debtorId}: Stores debtor information for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All subcollections are strictly user-owned.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'userId' is denormalized into each document within the income, expense, creditor, and debtor subcollections to avoid costly `get()` calls.
