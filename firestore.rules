/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only access data
 * associated with their own user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, including profile information,
 * transactions, debts, and bank accounts. This hierarchical structure simplifies
 * security rules and ensures data isolation.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users cannot list all users in the /users collection.
 * - All write operations are validated against the authenticated user's UID.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document fields is enforced on create
 *   and update operations to prevent unauthorized data manipulation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` field within each document is used to quickly verify ownership
 * without requiring additional reads. This denormalization improves performance
 * and reduces costs.
