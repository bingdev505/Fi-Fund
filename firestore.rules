/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for transactions, debts, and bank accounts.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Write access to user documents is restricted to the authenticated user with a matching ID.
 * - Data validation is limited to ownership fields to maintain relational integrity and path consistency.
