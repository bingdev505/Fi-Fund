/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for FinanceFlow AI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user's data (incomes, expenses, creditors, debtors) is stored under their respective user ID,
 * ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own financial records.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for incomes, expenses, creditors, and debtors.
 * - /users/{userId} (User profile information)
 * - /users/{userId}/incomes/{incomeId} (Income records)
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId} (Expense records)
 * - /users/{userId}/creditors/{creditorId} (Creditor records)
 * - /users/{userId}/debtors/{debtorId} (Debtor records)
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed by not providing a rule for it.
 * - All write operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - No data validation is performed beyond ownership checks in this prototyping phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The `userId` is present in every document, enabling fast ownership checks without additional reads. The `userId` is used to create path-based rules.
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  All user data is stored under the /users/{userId} path, ensuring private access.
